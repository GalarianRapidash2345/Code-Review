# Code Review Analysis

This code review analyzes and proposes the enhancements of three original artifacts for the Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases categories. The code review presented is an individual code review, where I am the sole reviewer of the artifact files. Being the sole reviewer, I can analyze my faults and create plans for the issues in the artifacts. I can use this code review to accept my mistakes and fail fast, which allows me to adapt to the industry. I intend to collaborate with team members on code reviews and incorporate their suggestions in the future. 

## Software Design/Engineering Category 
The Software Design/Engineering category originates from the artifacts within the course CS 410: Software Reverse Engineering. The pseudocode will improve the artifact and will be altered in the final enhancement one code.

## Algorithms and Data Structures Category
The Algorithms and Data Structures category originates from the artifacts within the course CS 405: Secure Coding. The pseudocode will improve the artifact and will be altered in the final enhancement two code.

## Databases Category
The Databases category originates from the artifacts within the course DAD 220: Introduction to SQL. The pseudocode will improve the artifact and will be altered in the final enhancement three code.
