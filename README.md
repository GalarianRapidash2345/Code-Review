# Code Review Analysis

This code review/embed/<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWou8g_Eeg4>  analyzes and proposes the enhancements of three original artifacts for the Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases categories. The code review presented is an individual code review, where I am the sole reviewer of the artifact files. Being the sole reviewer, I can analyze my faults and create plans for the issues in the artifacts. In addition, I can use this code review to accept mistakes and fail fast, which allows me to adapt to the industry. I intend to collaborate with team members on code reviews and incorporate their suggestions in the future.
