# Code Review Analysis

This [code review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWou8g_Eeg4) analyzes and proposes the enhancements of three original artifacts for the Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases categories. The code review presented is an individual code review, where I am the sole reviewer of the artifact files. Being the sole reviewer, I can analyze my faults and create plans for the issues in the artifacts. I can use this code review to accept my mistakes and fail fast, which allows me to adapt to the industry. I intend to collaborate with team members on code reviews and incorporate their suggestions in the future. 

## Software Design/Engineering Category 
The Software Design/Engineering category originates from the artifacts within the course CS 410: Software Reverse Engineering. The psuedocode presented will improve the artifact, and will be altered in the final enhancement code. 
### Psuedocode
```
START <stdio.h>


START int main(){

PRINT printf(“This C file was created by Clara Kellermann-Bryant”);

DEFINE int information, int customerchoice, int permissions, int i;

IF ( i = 1; i & gt 9; i) THEN

INITIALIZE int information = int customerchoice + int permissions;


PRINT printf( int customerchoice “+” int permissions “=” int information); 

}


START int ChangeCustomerChoice(){

DEFINE int customerchoice, int k;

IF (k = 1; k & gt 9; k) THEN

INITIALIZE int customerchoice = int k + 1;

PRINT printf(“Change customer choice”);


DEFINE int customerchoice2, int e;

IF (e = 1; e & gt 9; e) THEN

INITIALIZE int customerchoice2 = int e + 1;

PRINT printf(“Customer choice stays the same”);
}



START int CheckUserPermissionAccess() {


DEFINE int permissions, int g;

IF (g = 1; g & gt 9; g) THEN

INITIALIZE int permissions = int g + 1;

PRINT printf(“Permission is granted”);


DEFINE int permissions2, int h;

IF (h = 1; h & gt 9; h) THEN

INITIALIZE int permissions2 = int h + 1;

PRINT printf(“Permission denied”);

}



START int DisplayInfo () {


DEFINE int information, int information2, int customerchoice, int customerchoice2, int permissions, int permissions2;

INITIALIZE int information = int customerchoice + int permissions

INITIALIZE int information2 = int customerchoice2 + int permissions2


PRINT printf(customerchoice “+” permissions “=” information);

PRINT printf(customerchoice2 “+” permissions2 “=” information);

}
