<h1>Clara Kellermann-Bryant</h1>
<h2>Code Review</h2>
<p>This is a code review that analyzes and proposes the enhancements of three original artifacts for the Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases categories. The code review presented is an individual code review, 
  where I am the sole reviewer of the artifact files. Being the sole reviewer, I can analyze my faults and create plans for the issues in the artifacts. In addition, I can use this code review to accept mistakes and fail fast, which allows me to adapt to the industry. 
  I intend to collaborate with team members on code reviews and incorporate their suggestions in the future.</p>
